# LeetCode
This repository contains some of the problems I've completed on LeetCode.

Many problems I had completed in the integrated text editor, so I do not have them listed here.

# Directories
This repo contains 3 directories to separate the problems by difficulty. The directories are named Easy, Medium, and Hard.

# Naming Convention
These files are named the after the problem they represent. You can find the problems by navigating to the URL in the format below:

leetcode.com/problems/__NAME_OF_FILE__/

Be sure to leave out the file extension (often .java).

# Coding Language
So far, I've only worked on these in Java. This is because I want to practice Java more. I will likely branch out to solving these in other languages soon.

# Comment Blocks
Before I added these problems to Git, I would save my older versions of code by commenting them out on the same files. Some include runtimes in the comments. Just be aware of the large blocks of comments in some files.
